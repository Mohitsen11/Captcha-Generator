# Captcha-Generator
Created this project using Html, Css and JavaScript

<br>
CAPTCHA is a way to verify whether the user is human or not. It consists of a combination of letters and numbers. It ensures that users trying to access the platform are human. The Captcha Generator function can be used to verify identity, prevent fake registrations, prevent fake reviews and ensure that identity verification is carried out only by employees of the premises of online banking and financial institutions.

The project will be divided into three files: index.html, captcha.css and captcha.js. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the captcha generator, including the captcha box, submit button, and refresh button. CSS files are used to implement the structure of the captcha generator, while JavaScript files are used to add functionality to the creation and verification of captchas.
